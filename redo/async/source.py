    Calls an action function until it succeeds, or we give up.

    Args:

        retry_exceptions (tuple): tuple of exceptions to be caught. If other

                                  are immediately re-raised to the caller.
        cleanup (callable): optional; called if one of `retry_exceptions` is
                            caught. No arguments are passed to the cleanup
                            function; if your cleanup requires arguments,
